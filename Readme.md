# Essigstudios ISOHYVTT

This application / game was made as a _spare time project_ and is currently under development.
Please note that i made this game to play D&D online with friends while they are not physically
available - so this applications are designed for this use- case.
This project was released into the public because many other people may have the same issue, and
want to self- host their tabletop game.

*Many things are untested, and of course there are some bugs present.*

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK 7.0
- Newtonsoft.Json (NuGet package)
- Godot 4.1.1

## Notes

- Currently the server application does only run on Windows
- Some paths are currently hardcoded and waiting for an update
- It's actually not isometric, but you may use isometric assets ;)
